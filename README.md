# Code smells
Code repository for the 20 code smells discussed in my Udemy course.

## Pre-requisites

NodeJS version 14 or higher.
NPM version 6 or higher.

Installing NodeJS will already install NPM.

The easiest way to install NodeJS is to simply download the executable from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions, but if you are more familiar with programming, I recommend installing NodeJS via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

## Setting up the project

1. After extracting the ZIP file, change into the folder where the code is stored.
2. Run the command `npm ci` in the terminal.
3. You should be all set!

To execute a specific file, run the command `npm start -- <folder_name>` in the terminal, where `<folder_name>` is one of the 20 folders containing the code smells.
